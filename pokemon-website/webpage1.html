  <h1>Z-Moves</h1>
  <p>There are two main kinds of Z-Moves: Z-Moves which can be used by any Pokémon, with one Z-Move for each of the 18 types, and Z-Moves that can only be used by specific Pokémon. The Z-Move that a Pokémon can perform depends on the Z-Crystal it holds. There are 18 different Z-Crystals that correspond to each of the 18 types, and several others that correspond to specific Pokémon. Z-Moves work by powering up one of the Pokémon's normal moves, so the Pokémon must also know an appropriate move. For the type-related Z-Crystals, the Pokémon must know a move of the same type as the Z-Crystal it is holding. For the Pokémon-specific Z-Crystals, the move required differs for each Pokémon.
  A Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring is also required in order to perform Z-Moves. A Pokémon can only use a Z-Move if its Trainer is wearing a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring and has the same Z-Crystal the Pokémon is holding. Mega Evolved and Primal Pokémon cannot use Z-Moves, even when holding an appropriate Z-Crystal (such as after Transform). First I will start with the Z-Moves that can be used by any pokemon.</p>
  <h1>Breakneck Blitz</h1>
  <p>This is Breakneck Blitz, the normal type Z-Move. When using Breakneck Blitz, the user builds up its momentum using its Z-Power and crashes into the target at full speed. The power varies, depending on the original move.</p>
